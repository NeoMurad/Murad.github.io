    "**Background**: Every end of year, the federal government of Canada shares the low, median, and high estimations of the wage per hour for every occupation in every province and territory. For example, the data for Ontario can be found here: https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/wagereport/location/on\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: The wage reports are separate and do not compare provincial trends even though the data was collected and built on the provincial and territorial level. There is, accordingly, a lack of contextualization of discrepancies among provinces. Such that we are not able to see how differences among provinces can be mirrored in difference in wage per hour. Additionally, the released data is for each and every specific occupation. It doesn't display the different job hierarchy and classifications (NOC) as shown here: https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/Hierarchy?objectid=%2Fd0IGA6qD8JPRfoj5UCjpg%3D%3D\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: We are going to collect all the reports for the provinces in the year 2023, merge them, contextualize provincial differences (minimum wage, % of national GDP, population) as well as explore how the wages differ by different occupation hierarchies. We use Python for data cleaning and wrangling. Tableau is used for the visualization of the final data.\n",
