# Murad's Projects

Welcome! Here I showcase my personal and academic projects!

Some projects are only code-based while others include explanations and visualizations. The projects are as follows:


1) Coca-Cola Sales Operations
Tools used: Power BI
Analyzed and visualized different Coca-Cola sales metrics by US State and broke them down across sub-brands (Coke Diet, Dasani, et.c) by sales, price, margin, and profit.

2) Baseball Statistics Visualization
Tools used: Tableau
Analyzed and visualized different baseball player attributes (weight, height, etc.) and explored the relationship between the attributes and achievement records such as homeruns and batting averages. Established the existence of a correlational relationship through regression analysis on Tableau.

3) Deplatforming project
Developed and deployed a survey experiment on Amazon MTurk, using statistical t-tests to demonstrate a preference for deplatforming disliked over tolerated groups. Applied linear regression to identify factors affecting attitudes toward deplatforming. Tools used: Qualtrics, Amazon MTurk, R.
